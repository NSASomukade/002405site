Sometimes if you closed your eyes and held your breath, you'd feel her hand searching for yours under the covers. When you told your mom, she said it was only bad dreams.</label> <br /><br />
            <label for="hereditary2">Do you know where the bad dreams come from? </label>

There are bones in the foundation. This house is a graveyard. This house is a corpse. You are inside the corpse. That makes you the maggot.</label> <br /><br />

Everything's made up of other organisms that you can't see, living and dying hand in hand, blood in mouth, flesh in stomach. Somewhere within you, something had built a home. When was the last time you fed someone else at your table? Be glad that you still have something to offer. Don't think about it so hard.</label> <br /><br />

It's about what happened that night, at the sandlot you weren't allowed to play ball at because a pack of wild dogs lived there. Wild dogs are always hungry, you knew, but it was summer, and you felt invincible. You felt like you could swallow the whole world. You swallowed something else, and now you drag it around everywhere you go, roadkill on a leash. You tried to bury it, but it always gets dug up.</label> <br /><br />

It is real only when you can see your shadow. It is real in that, when it comes for you, you don't feel alone. It is a bad dream, which means you can escape it. All you have to do it wake up. But if you wake up, you're on your own again.</label> <br /><br />
