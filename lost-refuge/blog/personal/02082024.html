            <p>I was really hoping that the first post to my blog would be cute, or at least benign. Unfortunately, though, my cat died yesterday morning. I'm having lots of thoughts and feelings about it as you'd expect.</p>
            <p>It was more like mid-afternoon I guess. It started in the morning around 0900 because the night before I had told my dad I was taking him to the vet. We came back from a weekend trip Sunday night and when I picked him to say hello he was so light. (My cat was male, his name was Daniel.)</p>
            <p>I knew something was wrong (I knew it was old) but I also knew he had separation anxiety and might have just... gotten really anxious this last time. I felt bad (I hadn't wanted to go) but tried to make up for it by sitting with him while he ate his wet food (he was a social eater. He liked it when we watched him.)</p>
            <p>(I don't like writing in the past tense)</p>
            <p>He didn't eat as much as I expected him to. When he jumped up on my bed he slipped and fell. When he jumped off he stumbled. He wasn't purring. His tail wouldn't lift.</p>
            <p>His little paws and ears were cold. I hated that. I didn't want him to be cold, no one deserves their hands and their ears to be cold no one deserves to be cold. I set him on my heating pad so he could be warm and I was so happy when he started to stretch out instead of being in a tight little curl to conserve heat.</p>
            <p>Tuesday night I told my dad I was taking him to the vet.</p>
            <p>"What's wrong?" Everything was wrong. I think he knew when I told him. ("He's really light, he's stumbling, he's not eating as much, his paws are cold.")</p>
            <p>Neither of us said it though. My dad is allergic to cats but he let Daniel climb into his lap (for the last time, though I don't think either of us were genuinely considering that yet) and stayed on the couch with him for four hours. My parents have a large, tall bed. He pulled a chair and a pillow and a box up beside it so that Daniel could easily climb up and down. This is the first time in years he's slept in my parents room.</p>
            <p>The vet place we usually go to was booked out til monday (i knew what my dad was thinking when he kept offering to make the calls for me. He's always trying to do the emotional labor so we don't have to.) The third place we called said they could have us in an hour. I got Daniel into the car.</p>
            <p>I hated that part, too. He hates car-rides. He hates his carrier more. Hated*, sorry. He'd cry and pace and rub his little nose against the mesh until it bled. I hated putting him in the carrier. I would try to put my sleep-shirts in there with him but he would only calm down even a little if I held him in my lap.</p>
            <p>I didn't want to put him in the carrier but some vets don't let you walk in without one. I just put it in the back seat while I let him lay in my lap. I think this is the part that beats me up the most: he was so scared. He wasn't crying (once I let him stay in my lap) but he hates car rides and he couldn't see out the window because (as I fully realize now) he was too weak to climb up and look out of the window. Every time I had to brake he would shove his face into my stomach and I wanted to die a little more. I didn't want him to be scared. I wanted to introduce him to my car, I'd been trying to get him to hop in all on his own (sometimes he would) because I wanted to show him it wasn't scary and he could even enjoy it.</p>
            <p>When I parked (we got there early) I held him up so he could look out the windshield. He liked that part, he liked watching the cars. I realized it was the most alert I'd seen him in a while.</p>
            <p>As soon as we got into the exam room I let him out of the carrier. I let him walk around the room, because before now he didn't like to be picked up (especially not in strange areas) and he was sell-behaved for the nurse when she came in and weighed him and then she took him out to draw blood.</p>
            <p>(I didn't want to leave him but I understood they didn't want me back with the equiptment so I didn't ask.)</p>
            <p>It was the same nurse who came back (without him) and told me that his blood pressure was so low that they couldn't draw enough blood to test. He was too weak to support his own weight. She said at this point putting him down wouldn't be the wrong answer. A different nurse brough him back in (wrapped in a towel, he doesn't like to be wrapped up in things) and then I called my dad.</p>
            <p>I think I have an advantage over my family, in the grieving aspect at least. I think I was more prepared than them. Daniel and I spent a lot of time together. We all live in the same house (except for my mom, who spends 80% of her time in an apartment a city away) and so of course they'd all spent a lot of time with him just by virture of forced proximity but he was <i>my</i> cat. He used to be my mom's, before she moved out, and then he was mine, and he was always mine after that.</p>
            <p>I was more prepared because I spent the most time with him and saw it coming, I saw him getting weaker (i have to pause every time I write about that. about him getting weaker, I hate it). I knew he was old, and in the two days before I took him to the vet I think I already knew what was going to happen. My family didn't</p>
            <p>It was going to take two hours for my mom to get to the clinic from the next city over but the staff were very kind and they told me I could stay in the room (I didn't want to put him in the car again could you imagine how--I wasn't going to do it.) They gave me some doritos and oreo cookies and a paper cup of water. I let daniel walk around the room until I realized he was</p>
            <p>Fuck, man, I don't know. He was just wandering, and occassionlly meowing in the way he did when we weren't opening the door for him and he wanted out and he's never going to do that again. I don't know. I was still mad about him being cold and the floor was cold and his paws were already cold so I pulled him into my lap and sat in the little sunbeam cast by the window and let him sleep. They were playing bird noises over the speaker but I don't think he really cared. I was just glad he was warming up.</p>
            <p>Eventually I took him outside because the sun was moving and what better source of sun than being out in the sun right? I hate that it's winter and cold enough that I could see my breath and I could see <i>his</i> breath but I didn't want to do back in where I wouldn't be able to put him in the sun and at least this way he could sit in the sun and be warm</p>
            <p>My dad came after he picked up my sister from school and we sat with him outside. My dad and I talked about him some, told some stories, Kit was too sad to talk but that's okay. I gave her a capri sun out of the trunk of my car and eventually the nurse came out to check on us. My mom was 45min away and so she said that she'd try to put the catheter in now (she would only try once, and if it didn't work with his veins she'd give it up and we would sedate him.)</p>
            <p>It didn't work. His viens were too small. The sun had moved back to a place where I could sit so I did and I put him back in my lap.</p>
            <p>I know everyone grieves differently, but I can't stand the way my mom grieves. It feels performative. She burst into the room on the edge of a sob and I wanted to hide him from her.</p>
            <p>I didn't, he was her cat before he was mine, and she had just as much a right to grieve performatively as I do to grieve quietly and irreverantly.</p>
            <p>I think I've said as much as I can, at this point. I'm less trying to exorsise this than I am trying to process it, in a way. If anyone does read this I appreciate it, I probably won't respond to any comments but I'll read them. I don't know how to respond to people sending emotion at me, although often it means a lot to me. I dunno. I wanted to get this blog thing up and it's not as clean/finished/exactly what I wanted it to be but I think that's good. I think it's good to stop hemming over it and just fucking. Put the damn thing out there to exist. The layout I mean. This entry was always going to look like this.</p>
            <p>And I mean like... I'm okay. Or I'll be okay or whatever, because that's just how it works. Maybe I'll feel the urge to finish this memoir(?) at some point in the future and maybe I won't.</p>
            <p>Hope everyone else is having a good week though, or is getting ready to have a good weekend. C'est la vie.</p>
