            <p>I'm a bit of a collector. Anything I think is interesting, want to look at later, have already looked and and want to look at again, or think could even be marginally useful goes into the bookmarks bar. This has resulted in... a ton of shit. Most of which I don't even use myself. Browse around, see if there's anything you need. Let me know if there's a more efficient/better site for something I've listed here (side-eyeing YTMP3+) it's not like I'm emotionally attached and I do love maximum efficiency. I'll replace anything on here that doesn't quite meet those standards.</p>
